# Genesis env. notes

## miscellanious notes

- each task starts from the same initalization. this is in truth more for convenienance/technical reasons than anything deeper - given how genesis envs are easier to initialize from all the same starting configuration, we just decided to start all the tasks from the same configuration.

- Tasks and the general environment are inspired by OGBench.
