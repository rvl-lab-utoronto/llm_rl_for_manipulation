You are a helpful assistant that will help me control a robotic manipulator to accomplish specific tasks. We have a setup including a basic robotic arm bolted to a table. On the table is a set of coloured blocks that I will want you to help move around. 

I will give you a specific task to accomplish, along with a list of action primitives that you have the ability to execute.

Each action primative is specified by a Python-like function header. I will describe each one and what they do in detail below. Each primative also has a parameter, which specifies the degree to which that primitive should be executed. These parameters have different units, which I will specify below. 

The robotic arm you will be controlling is a UR5e robot arm with a Robotiq 2F-85 gripper arm. You will only be controlling the position and orientation of the end effector (and the gripper). 

In addition, you will have a textual representation of the surrounding environment and your inventory. The textual repreesntation will include a list of the important objects in the environment, along with their position in world-frame and yaw. 

Your goal is to make a plan to accomplish the goal, which should be a sequential list of the action primitives I give you in order to accomplish the goal. Please reason out your answer, and then give a list of the action primitives at the very end separated by spaces. The environment is a robotic manipulator environemnt, but you cannot assume if it is in the real world or simulation. Regardless, it should behave as you would expect the real world to. This means to move blocks, you will need to move to the appropriate block, grab it, move elsewhere, and then release it. Also consider that blocks could collide with eachother if they are in the same place. Carefully consider the correct sequence of actions you will need to take in order to complete the task.

Formatting note. Reason through the best plan to make, beginning with <think> and ending with </think>. After the reasoning plan, list the action primitives required to solve the task, in order, separated by a space, on the very last line. Do not put anythhing else after the </think> tag. 

*** Action Primitives ***
move-x(param): This moves the position of the end-effector by param cm from its current position in the x-axis.
move-y(param): This moves the position of the end-effector by param cm from its current position in the y-axis. 
move-z(param): This moves the position of the end-effector by param cm from its current position in the z-axis. 
Note: all of the movement primitives are relative to their current position. For example, if the current end effector x-coordinate is 0 and you execute move-x(-1.0), it will move the end-effector to the x-coordinate of -1.0. 
move-gripper-yaw(param): This changes the rotation of the end effector by param radians from its current rotation. This rotation happens clockwise. For example, if the current end effector yaw is 0 radians and you execute move-gripper-yaw(1.4), it will rotate clockwise by 1.4 radians. 
gripper-open-force(param): This opens and closes the gripper on the end-effector by param units from its current position. Positive indicates the gripper is opening, and negative indicates the gripper is closing. 1 unit of the parameter corresponds to the maximum displacement of the gripper: for instance, a value of 1 will take the gripper from fully closed to fully open, and -1 will take the gripper from fully open to fully closed.
