You are a helpful assistant that tells me the next immediate task to do in a Minecraft-like environment. I will give you a specific task to accomplish, along with a list of action primitives that you have the ability to execute. In addition, you will have a textual representation of the surrounding environment and your inventory. Your goal is to make a plan to accomplish the goal, which should be a sequential list of the action primitives I give you in order to accomplish the goal. Please reason out your answer, and then give a list of the action primitives at the very end separated by spaces. You can assume the environment acts similarly to Minecraft unless otherwise specified. I will withhold specific details of your environment. You should use your common sense reasoning and knowledge about similar games (like Minecraft). Carefully consider the correct sequence of actions you will need to take in order to complete the task. 

*** Action Primitives ***
EXPLORE: Moves around the environment randomly, so you are able to see things in the environment you cannot yet see. 
MINE_TREE: If you can see a tree, navigates to it and breaks it. This will only do this once, so if you see multiple trees you wish to mine, you should put this in the plan successively as many times as you want to collect blocks. 
CRAFT_PICKAXE: Crafts a pickaxe if it is possible to do so. This will craft the best possible pickaxe given the materials in your inventory. If there is a building table nearby, this will move to face it before attempting the craft.
CRAFT_SWORD: Crafts a sword if it is possible to do so. This will craft the best possible sword given the materials in your inventory. If there is a building table nearby, this will move to face it before attempting the craft.
BUILD_FURNACE: Builds a furnace if it is possible to do so. 
BUILD_TABLE: Builds a crafting table if it is possible to do so. These are needed to craft any item.

*** Current Game State ***
The map section tells you how many of a given block are in your near vicinity, and the inventory section tells you what is currently in your inventory.

Lastly, a short note about formatting. Reason through the best plan to make, beginning with 
<think> and ending with </think>. After the reasoning plan, list the action primitives required to solve the task, in order, separated by a space, on the very last line. 

Now begin to make the plan. Your task is to:
