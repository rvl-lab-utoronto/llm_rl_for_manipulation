If I don't, I'll need to gather them.\\n\\nI think the first step is to gather wood. In Minecraft, you can break trees to get wood. So I should look for a tree. Once I find one, I can use the MINE_TREE action to break it. That should give me some wood. After mining, I'll have wood in my inventory.\\n\\nNext, I need sticks. Sticks can be obtained by breaking wooden slabs or planks. So after mining the tree, I might need to break some of the resulting planks to get sticks. I can use the MINE_TREE action again on the planks if I have any left, or maybe I can break them with an axe once I have one.\\n\\nWait, do I have an axe yet? If I don't, I might need to craft one first. But crafting an axe requires wood and gravel, so that might complicate things. Maybe I can proceed without an axe for now and focus on gathering sticks.\\n\\nOnce I have enough sticks, I can go to a crafting table. I need to build a crafting table if I don't have one. So I should check if I have the materials to build one. Crafting tables require four planks, so if I have enough planks from the tree, I can build it using the BUILD_TABLE action.\\n\\nAfter having a crafting table, I can use it to craft the pickaxe. The pickaxe recipe in Minecraft requires one stick and two wooden slabs. So I need to make sure I have those components. If I don't have enough sticks, I might need to repeat the stick-gathering process.\\n\\nOnce I have all the materials, I can use the CRAFT_PICKAXE action. It should craft the pickaxe automatically, using the best possible materials I have. I don't need to worry about the quality since the action will handle it.\\n\\nI should also consider the order of actions. Maybe I should first mine the tree, then gather sticks, build the crafting table if needed, and then craft the pickaxe. Let me outline the steps:\\n\\n1. Explore to find a tree.\\n2. Mine the tree to get wood.\\n3. Break planks or\")"
